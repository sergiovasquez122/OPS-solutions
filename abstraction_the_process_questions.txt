1. Run process-run.py with the following flags -l 5:100, 5:100
What should the CPU utilization be. Why do you know this?

The CPU utilization should be 100% since we are only
using the CPU and not IO

actual output
./processs-run.py -c -p -l 5:100,5:100 
Time    PID: 0    PID: 1       CPU       IOs

2. Now run with these flags: ./process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0. These flags specify one with process with 4 instructions and one that simply issues an I/O and waits for it to be done. How longs does it take to complete both processes? 

it should take 10 seconds to complete both processes.
the first process has 4 pure cpu instructions and thus
will take 4 time units to complete. The other instruction
use an I/O which takes 5 units to wait and then one
other second to complete the process

./process-run.py -c -p -l 4:100,1:0

  3    RUN:cpu     READY         1
