1. Run process-run.py with the following flags -l 5:100, 5:100
What should the CPU utilization be. Why do you know this?

The CPU utilization should be 100% since we are only
using the CPU and not IO

2. Now run with these flags: ./process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0. These flags specify one with process with 4 instructions and one that simply issues an I/O and waits for it to be done. How longs does it take to complete both processes? 

it should take 10 seconds to complete both processes.
the first process has 4 pure cpu instructions and thus
will take 4 time units to complete. The other instruction
use an I/O which takes 5 units to wait and then one
other second to complete the process

./process-run.py -c -p -l 4:100,1:0 
Time    PID: 0    PID: 1       CPU       IOs
  1    RUN:cpu     READY         1

  3    RUN:cpu     READY         1

3. Switch the order of the processes: -l 1:0,4:100 now? Does switching the order matter?

it does matter the order in which we order the 
processes. If we do it like above then while
the 1st command is waiting for IO the other command
will be executing. The total time will reduce to
6 because the first command which takes 5 time units
will wait while the other command will be executing
during the 4 times units. all tasks are then
issued the done status for an additional second.

./process-run.py -c -p -l 1:0,4:100
Time    PID: 0    PID: 1       CPU       IOs
  1     RUN:io     READY         1          
  2    WAITING   RUN:cpu         1         1
  3    WAITING   RUN:cpu         1         1
  4    WAITING   RUN:cpu         1         1
  5    WAITING   RUN:cpu         1         1

4. Weâ€™ll now explore some of the other flags. One important flag is
-S, which determines how the system reacts when a process is-
sues an I/O. With the flag set to SWITCH ON END, the system
will NOT switch to another process while one is doing I/O, in-
stead waiting until the process is completely finished. What hap-
pens when you run the following two processes (-l 1:0,4:100
-c -S SWITCH ON END), one doing I/O and the other doing CPU
work?

It will no longer execute the CPU instructions while we
are waiting for the IO process thus we will spend 5 time
units waiting for the process to complete. From there
we can execute the CPU instrucions for an additional
4 seconds. The total time is 9 seconds.

./process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_END
Time    PID: 0    PID: 1       CPU       IOs
  1     RUN:io     READY         1          
  2    WAITING     READY                   1
  3    WAITING     READY                   1
  4    WAITING     READY                   1
  5    WAITING     READY                   1
  6*      DONE   RUN:cpu         1          
  7       DONE   RUN:cpu         1          
  8       DONE   RUN:cpu         1          
  9       DONE   RUN:cpu         1     

5. Now, run the same processes, but with the switching behavior set
to switch to another process whenever one is WAITING for I/O (-l
1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH ON IO). What happens now? Use -c
and -p to confirm that you are right.

The analysis should now revert back to question (3)

./process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_IO -p
Time    PID: 0    PID: 1       CPU       IOs
  1     RUN:io     READY         1          
  2    WAITING   RUN:cpu         1         1
  3    WAITING   RUN:cpu         1         1
  4    WAITING   RUN:cpu         1         1
  5    WAITING   RUN:cpu         1         1
  6*      DONE      DONE         1
